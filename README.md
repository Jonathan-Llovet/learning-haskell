# Learning the Haskell programming language
This repo is to centralize resources, projects, notes, and exercises for learning Haskell. My hope is that if I keep track of what I do while learning it, someone else might find some use in it to explore Haskell and functional programming themselves.

# Installation
Instructions for installing Haskell can be found here: [haskell.org](https://www.haskell.org/)

# Resources
Books, videos, blog posts, and other materials useful for learning Haskell and related topics will be added in [/resources](https://github.com/Jonathan-Llovet/learning-haskell/resources).
