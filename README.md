# Learning the Haskell programming language
This repo is to centralize resources, projects, notes, and exercises for learning Haskell. My hope is that if I keep track of what I do while learning it, someone else might find some use in it to explore Haskell and functional programming themselves.

# Installation
Instructions for installing Haskell can be found here: [haskell.org](https://www.haskell.org/)

# Resources
As I work through various features of the language and am experimenting with new concepts,
I will be drawing from different resources. The folders and files in the repo will be named and numbered in a way that reflects the order that I worked on exercises and topics.
