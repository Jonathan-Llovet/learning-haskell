#This repository is to track my progress while learning the Haskell programming language

#Installation
Instructions for installing Haskell can be found here: [haskell.org](https://www.haskell.org/)

#Resources
As I work through various features of the language and am experimenting with new concepts,
I will be drawing from different resources. The folders and files in the repo will be named and numbered in a way that reflects the order that I worked on exercises and topics.
